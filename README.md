# BMI-Calculator-Python-Project-1
Calculation of BMI (Body Mass Index) in Python by taking the user's weight and height as input and then calculating the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight(kg) / (height(m) * height(m))

I have created this simple Python project with the help of Alex Frebergâ€™s Python tutorials.
